The conference website recently changes to a new layout and site organization:

* [Past conferences](https://www.europlop.net/past-conferences/) (with links to proceedings in ACM Digital Library)
* [Call for Papers (2023)](https://www.europlop.net/call-for-papers/)
* [Starter Kit (.zip)](http://hillside.net/europlop/europlop2012/pattern_introduction_pack2012.zip)
* to be continued

The old website is available via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://www.europlop.net/) maintained by the Internet Archive.
